#tivit 'feiras' rest api

    This project aims to provide a REST api to query and manage some recorded data.
    It is based on python django framework and SQLite database.

# install

    Before try to run django app service the following python dependecies mut be installed.
    I recommend the use of python virtual env to keep your own python installation safe of changes.

    clone repository:
        mkdir project
        cd project
        git clone https://github.com/vshofar/tivit.git

    virtualenv:
        

        pip install virtualenv           
        virtualenv env
        source env/bin/activate        

    dependencies:
        
        pip install django
        pip install djangorestframework   
        pip install requests
